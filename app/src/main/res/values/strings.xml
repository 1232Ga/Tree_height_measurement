    <string name="question_1">Why do we use a user code?</string>
    <string name="answer_1">The user code feature is specifically designed for individuals logging in for the first time without internet connectivity. This functionality enables users to access the app offline, allowing them to utilize its features even when they are not connected to the internet.</string>
    <string name="question_2">How can we add data for a tree?</string>
    <string name="answer_2">To input tree data, it\'s mandatory to capture two photographs. Your location will be automatically recorded using GeoCode, so please ensure your GPS is enabled. You have the flexibility to select the units for measuring height and girth based on your preference. All fields must be completed, except for the height field, which is optional. Once you save the data for the tree species, it will be stored locally on your device.</string>
    <string name="question_3">How can we synchronize the captured tree data?</string>
    <string name="answer_3">All captured data will be showcased on the Data Sync page, simplifying the process of uploading your tree data with just one click. For first-time data uploads while logged in, you\'ll need to use a user code. The system will then verify the correctness of the user code provided. If the user code is incorrect, you\'ll have the option to change it, or alternatively, proceed via username and password authentication.</string>
    <string name="question_4">How do we add a new species?</string>
    <string name="answer_4">If you come across a species that is not currently listed, you can add it by selecting the "Add species" option from the popup menu on the dashboard. When adding a species name, you must provide a brief description explaining why this species should be included. Your submission will undergo review by an administrator, and upon approval, it will be added to the species list.</string>
    <string name="question_5">How do we export and create an Excel sheet for the tree data we\'ve added?</string>
    <string name="answer_5">To generate an Excel sheet for your added tree data, tap on the "Export" button. A dialog box will appear, enabling you to filter your data by date, species, reserve forest (RF), and district. After selecting your criteria and tapping on the "Export" button, an Excel file will be created and saved in the download folder of your file manager for easy access.</string>
